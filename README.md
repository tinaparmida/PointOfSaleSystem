# PointOfSaleSystem

This reponsitory contains a POS system designed in C++ language. This was a milestone 
project in Object Oriented Programming.

The milestone project was a critical aspect of our learning experience, providing 
us with the opportunity to apply our knowledge and skills in a practical setting. 
Throughout the project, we had to manage our time effectively, ensuring that we met
the various deadlines and milestones that were set for us.

To manage our time effectively, we used a variety of techniques, such as creating a
detailed project plan, breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, 
and using time-tracking software to monitor our progress and identify potential areas 
of delay. We also learned to prioritize tasks and set realistic goals, which helped us 
stay focused and productive throughout the project.

Another important aspect of the project was the use of debugging tools to identify and 
fix errors in our code. We used a variety of tools, including the debugger, print statements, 
and code profiling tools, to identify issues and track down bugs. By using these tools, 
we were able to create more robust and reliable code, and avoid common errors that can 
lead to crashes or other issues.

In addition to these techniques, we also had to apply many of the key concepts and 
techniques we had learned throughout the course, including inheritance, polymorphism, 
and custom I/O operators. We also used function templates, virtual functions, and abstract 
base classes to create a flexible and extensible system that could be easily modified and 
updated as needed.

Overall, the milestone project was an excellent opportunity to apply our knowledge and 
skills in a practical setting, and to gain valuable experience working on a large-scale 
project. By using effective time management techniques and debugging tools, we were able 
to complete the project on time and with a high degree of quality, which will be valuable 
skills as we move forward in our careers as programmers. This project demonstrated the 
importance of having strong technical skills, as well as the ability to manage projects 
effectively and work collaboratively in a team environment.
